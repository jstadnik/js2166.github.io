Forked from my old github account (rather than merge accounts) to not lose the hosting on the free github.io page associated with the old account. This is for now anyway, until I have projects on my new GitHub that better show off my current skills in front-end web dev. Created with two other students as part of "Code First: Girls" web dev course in 2015.
